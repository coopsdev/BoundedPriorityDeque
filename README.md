# EARLY RELEASE | ACTIVELY IN DEVELOPMENT
### A performant bounded priority deque, currently in active dev. 
* The goal is a priority deque (missing from the std c++ lib) that is bounded and highly performant.
* Inspired for use in multithreaded ball tree construction and query contexts for TSP solutions with maximum performance.
### More info coming soon...
